                  The cost of landscaping can vary widely depending on factors
                  such as the size of the area, the complexity of the design,
                  the types of materials used, and the region's labor costs.
                  Small residential projects, such as adding plants or a small
                  patio, can start from a few hundred dollars, while
                  larger-scale projects involving extensive design work,
                  hardscaping, and planting can range from several thousand to
                  tens of thousands of dollars or more.
